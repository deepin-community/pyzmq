Subject: check package root for cffi binaries

cffi checks __pycache__ for binaries which is cleaned by pypy
installation so packages can't ship in there.

Instead ship in package root and patch module finding to look in there.
Also use fixed path in a place passed to cffi to get the same checksum
in build and install. After it is installed no build is needed so it
doesn't matter if its wrong.

This patch assumes pypy 2.2 api, won't work with 2.1 as so_suffices is
no list.

Bug: https://bitbucket.org/cffi/cffi/issue/109/enable-sane-packaging-for-cffi
Patch-Name: cffi-fix.patch
